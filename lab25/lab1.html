    <h1>Practicing with CSS</h1>
    
    <p style="color: blue;">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to apply styles—such as colors, fonts, spacing, 
        and layout—to HTML elements. By separating the content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS), 
        developers can update the design of an entire website by editing just one CSS file 
        rather than changing every individual HTML document.</p>
